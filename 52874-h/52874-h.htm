<h3 class='c001'>A HISTORY OF MEDICINE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>BY JOHN BENNITT, M. D.,</div>
    <div class='c006'>Professor of Principles and Practice of Medicine in the Medical Department of the Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It may not be inappropriate to give in your journal a brief
sketch of the history of medicine, by the consideration of which
we may come to a better appreciation of our present standpoint
as medical men. We may also the better understand how
much we, as medical men, and the world at large, are indebted
to the methodical, plodding workers of the past in the field of
inquiry pertaining to the nature and cure of disease. Such
review may have the effect of stimulating medical men to more
careful observation and the recording the results of observations
that they may be given to others for mutual benefit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Science may be defined as “classified knowledge.” But all
our knowledge is based on experience and observation. Medical
science, like other sciences, taking the definition of Sir
John Herschel, is “the knowledge of many, orderly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>methodically digested and arranged so as to become attainable
by one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In all cases art and observation precede and beget science,
and give origin to its gradual construction. But soon science,
so built up, begins to reflect new light upon its parents—observation
and art—helps them onward, expands the range of
vision, corrects their errors, improves their methods and suggests
new ones. The stars were mapped out and counted by
the shepherds watching their flocks by night, long before
astronomy assumed any scientific form.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the earliest ages the pains and disorders of the human
body must have arrested men's anxious attention and claimed
their succor. The facts observed, both as to hurts and diseases,
and as to their attempted remedying, were handed down by
tradition or by record from generation to generation in continually
increasing abundance, and out of the repeated survey and
comparison of these has grown the recognition of certain laws
of events and rules of action, which together constitute “medical
science.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is good reason for the belief that Egypt was the
country in which the <em>art</em> of medicine, as well as the other arts
of civilized life, was first cultivated with any degree of success,
the offices of the priest and the physician being probably combined
in the same person. In the writings of Moses there are
various allusions to the practice of medicine amongst the Jews,
especially with reference to the diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.
The priests were the physicians, and their treatment
mainly aimed at promoting cleanliness and preventing contagion.
The same practice is approved by the light of latest
science.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chiron, the Centaur, is said to have introduced the art of
medicine amongst the Greeks, but the early history of the <em>art</em>
is entirely legendary. Æsculapius appears in Homer as an
excellent physician of <em>human</em> origin; in the later legends he
becomes the god of the healing art. His genealogy is obscure
and altogether fabulous. He, however, soon surpassed his
teacher, Chiron, and succeeded so far as to restore the dead to
life (as the story goes). This offended Hades, who began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>fear that his realm would not be sufficiently peopled; complained
to Zeus (Jove) of the innovation, and Jove slew Æsculapius
by a flash of lightning. After this he was deified by the
gratitude of mankind, and was especially worshiped at Epidaurus,
where a temple and a grove were consecrated to him. His
statue in this temple was formed of gold and ivory, and represents
him as a god seated on a throne, and holding in one hand
a staff with a snake coiled around it, the other hand resting on
the head of a snake; a dog, as an emblem of watchfulness, at
his feet (an intimation very appropriate for the medical profession).
The Asclepiades, the followers of Æsculapius, inherited
and kept the secrets of the healing art; or, assuming that
Æsculapius was merely a divine symbol, the Asclepiades must
be regarded as a medical, priestly caste, who preserved as mysteries
the doctrine of medicine. The members of the caste
were bound by an oath—the Hippocratis jusjurandum—not to
divulge the secrets of their profession.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Rome, in the year 292 B. C., a pestilence (probably malarial
fever) prevailed. The Sibyline books directed that Æsculapius
(statue!) must be brought from Epidaurus. Accordingly,
an embassy was sent to this place, and when they had made
their request, a snake crept out of the temple into the ship.
Regarding this as the god Æsculapius, they sailed to Italy, and
as they entered the Tiber the snake sprang out upon an island,
where afterwards a temple was erected to Æsculapius and a
company of priests appointed to take charge of the service and
practice the art of medicine. The name Æsculapius, then, is
only an impersonation of medicine in the remote ages, or early
ages of Grecian history.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hippocrates is the first writer of medicine whose works have
come down to us with anything like authority other than fable.
Indeed, he was the most celebrated physician of antiquity. He
was the son of Heracleides, also a physician, and belonged to
the family of the Asclepiades, said to be about eighteen generations
from Æsculapius. His mother was said to be descended
from Hercules.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hippocrates was born in the island of Cos (more anciently
Meropis), an island of the Grecian archipelago of about one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>hundred square miles, probably about the year 460 B. C. Instructed
in medicine by his father and other contemporary medical
men, he traveled in various parts of Greece and Asia minor.
He finally settled and practiced his profession at Cos, but died
in Thessaly at the age of one hundred and four years (B. C.
357). Little is known of his personal history, other than that
he was highly esteemed as a physician and an author, and that
he raised the reputation of the medical school of Cos to a high
degree. His works were studied and quoted by Plato. He
was famous in his own time, and his works, some sixty in number,
have in them many things that are not unworthy of consideration
even after the lapse of twenty-two hundred years.
Many of the works ascribed to Hippocrates are <em>not</em> well
authenticated.</p>

<p class='c000'>He divided the causes of diseases into two principal classes—the
first consisting of the influence of seasons, climates, water,
situations, etc.; the second of more personal causes, such as
the food and exercise of the individual patient. His belief in
the influence which different climates exert on the human constitution
is very strongly expressed. He ascribes to this influence
both the conformation of the body and the disposition of
the mind, and hence accounts for the difference between the
hardy Greek and the Asiatic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The four humors of the body (blood, phlegm, yellow bile
and black bile) were regarded by him as the primary seats of
disease; health was the result of the due combination (or
crasis) of these humors, and illness was the consequence of a
disturbance of this crasis. When a disease was progressing
favorably these humors underwent a certain change (coction),
which was the sign of returning health, as preparing the way
for the expulsion of morbid matters, or crisis, these crises having
a tendency to occur at definite periods, which were hence
called critical days.</p>

<p class='c000'>His treatment of disease was cautious and what we now
term expectant, <em>i. e.</em>, it consisted chiefly, often solely, in attention
to diet and regimen; and he was sometimes reproached
with letting his patients die by doing nothing to keep them
alive.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>His works written in Greek were at an early period translated
into Arabic. They were first printed in Latin in 1525,
at Rome. A complete edition in Greek bears a date a year
later.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several editions in Latin and other languages have appeared
from time to time. An English translation of 'The Genuine
Works of Hippocrates,' was published by the Sydenham society
in 1848, in 2 vols., by Dr. Adams. The advance which
Hippocrates made in the practice of medicine was so great that
no attempts were made for some centuries to improve upon
his views and precepts. His sons, Thessalus and Draco, and
his son-in-law, Polybius, are regarded as the founders of the
medical sect which was called the Hippocratean or Dogmatic
school, because it professed to set out with certain theoretical
principles, which were derived from the generalization of facts
and observations, and to make these principles the basis of
practice. The next epoch in the history of medicine is the establishment
of the school at Alexandria, which was effected by
the munificence of the Ptolemies, about B. C. 300. Indeed the
whole race of Ptolemies (from Ptolemy I. to Ptolemy VII. B.
C. 323 to 117) seem to have been patrons of learning and
learned men. (Less so Ptolemy VIII. to XIII., B. C. 117 to
43. Ptolemy II., Philadelphius, was born in Cos about 150
years after Hippocrates.) It was by the patronage of these
kings of Egypt that learning flourished in Alexandria during
their reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some of them this seems to have been the only redeeming
feature of their character. Otherwise vicious, cruel, bloodthirsty
in an extreme degree, they uniformly encouraged learning and
learned men. (It seems to have been a hereditary trait.)
Amongst the most famous of the medical professors of the
School of Alexandria are Erasistratus and Herophilus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The former of these was a pupil of Chrysippus, and probably
imbibed from his master his prejudice against bleeding and
against the use of active remedies, preferring to trust mainly to
diet and to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturae</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Herophilus, born in Chalcedon, in Bythinia, flourished in the
latter part of the fourth and the beginning of the third century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>B. C., and settled in Alexandria, especially was distinguished
by his devotion to the study of anatomy. He is said to have
pursued this to such an extent as to have dissected criminals
alive. Several names which he gave to different parts of the
body are still in use, as the torcular Herophili, calamus scriptorius,
and duodenum. He located the seat of the soul in the
ventricles of the brain. Only a few fragments remain of what
he wrote.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time the Empirics formed themselves into a distinct
sect and became the declared opponents of the Dogmatists.
The controversy really consisted in the question, “How
far we are to suffer theory to influence over practice.” While
the Dogmatists, or as they were sometimes styled, the Rationalists,
asserted that before attempting to treat any disease we
ought to make ourselves fully acquainted with the structure and
functions of the body generally, with the operation of medicinal
agents upon it, and with the changes which it undergoes
when under the operation of any morbid cause, the Empirics,
on the contrary, contended that this knowledge is impossible
to be obtained and if possible is not necessary; that our
sole guide must be experience and that if we step beyond this,
either as learned from our own observations or that of others
on whose testimony we can rely, we are always liable to fall into
dangerous and often fatal errors. According to Celsus, the
founder of the Empirics was Serapion, who was said to be a
pupil of Herophilus. At this period, and for some centuries
later, all physicians were included in one or the other of these
rival sects, and from the evidence of history the two sects or
schools were about equal. From Phiny, who wrote about the
middle and sixth, seventh and eighth decades of the first century,
we learn that medicine was introduced into Rome at a
later period than the other arts and sciences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first person who seems to have made it a distinct profession,
separate from priestcraft, was Archagathus, a Peloponnesian,
who settled at Rome about B. C. 200. His treatment
of his patients was so severe and unsuccessful that he was finally
banished, and no other mention is made of a physician at Rome
for about a century, when Asclepiades of Bythinia, acquired a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>great reputation. His popularity depended upon his allowing
his patients a liberal use of wine, and of their favorite dishes, and
in all respects consulting their inclinations and flattering their
prejudices; and hence it is easy to understand the eminence at
which he arrived, for we see even in our own time men building
up great reputations by similar practices.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man with a long name—Archagathus—was succeeded by
his pupil, Themison of Laodicea, the founder of a sect called
Methodics, who adopted a middle course between the Dogmatists
and Empirics. During the greater part of the first two
centuries of our era the Methodics were the preponderating
medical sect, and they included in their ranks C. Aurelianus,
some of whose writings have come down to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>They soon broke into various sects of which the chief were
the Pneumatics, represented by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, whose
works are still extant; and the Eclectics, who claimed
as do the Eclectics of to-day, to select the best from
all the other systems and to reject the hurtful. The
most remarkable writer of this age is Celsus (about A. D.),
whose work (De Medicina) gives a sketch of the history of
medicine up to that time and the state in which it then was.
He is remarkable in being the first <em>native</em> Roman physician
whose name has come down to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dioscorides of Cilicia flourished about the end of the first
century. He accompanied the Roman army in their campaign
through many countries and gathered a great store of information
and observations on plants. In his great work 'De Materia
Medica,' he treats of all the then known medicinal substances
and their properties, real or reputed, on the principles of the so-called
humoral pathology. Two other works are ascribed to
him but their genuineness is questionable. For fifteen centuries
the authority of Dioscorides, in botany and materia medica,
was undisputed, and still holds among the Turks and Moors.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>REPORT OF A CASE OF EXTRA-UTERINE PREGNANCY.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>BY H. J. LEE, M. D., CLEVELAND, OHIO.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The following case came under my care during my term of
service in the wards of Charity Hospital in this city. Mrs. D.,
age thirty-five, married, one child two years of age, was
admitted to the hospital July 14, 1885, with the following history:
She had always enjoyed good health, and there was no
history of uterine disease. She menstruated about the first of
April, 1885, did not menstruate in May, and supposed herself
pregnant, as she had always been regular before, and during the
latter part of May she had considerable nausea and other
symptoms of pregnancy. About the first of June, while in
church, she was taken with a severe hemorrhage. She was
taken home and a physician called, who examined her and
decided from the symptoms and history that she had had a
miscarriage. There was very little hemorrhage after she
arrived home, in fact very little at any subsequent time, but
she did not recover well, had some pains in the abdomen, and
she said had some fever all the time. Not getting on well, as
she and her friends thought, it was decided to change physicians,
which was done. The second physician concurred in the
diagnosis of the first, and treated her evidently on the expectant
plan, as any one would be compelled to do, owing to the
difficulty of making a correct diagnosis at such an early stage.
After a time, there being no improvement, she decided to go
to the hospital. On admission she was quite emaciated and
had an anaemic appearance; her temperature was about 99° to
100° in the morning and 100° to 102° in the evening. There
was considerable tenderness in the right iliac region, extending
into the hypogastric region. Uterus was not felt to be at all
enlarged, but the os was patulous. There was an enlargement
to the right of the uterus. This could be felt both externally
and through the vagina; was of an irregular outline, and quite
tense and tender upon pressure. A sound was introduced
into the uterus and passed in about three inches and was
deflected to the left quite perceptibly. It did not appear quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>certain that there was nothing in the uterus, and in view of the
history of the case it seemed justifiable to explore the cavity.
Accordingly a good sized sponge tent was introduced and
allowed to remain twenty-four hours, when it was removed and
the uterine cavity explored with purely negative results. The
patient had now been under observation over a week, and
attempts made to improve her general condition with tonics
and nutritious diet, but without success. Her temperature continued
about 101° most of the time. A positive diagnosis had
not been made, though it seemed that about everything could
be excluded except extra-uterine pregnancy. At this juncture
Dr. W. J. Scott was asked to see the patient. He did so and
made a very careful examination, and gave it as his opinion
the case was one of extra-uterine pregnancy. The next day
Dr. Dudley P. Allen was called in consultation with Dr. Scott
and myself. Dr. Allen's examination was careful and exhaustive,
and at its close he gave it as his opinion that while there
were some obscure points, the most probable conclusion was
that the case was one of extra-uterine fœtation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having all arrived at this conclusion, independently of
each other, it was agreed that as there was some obscurity in
the case, and also that in the event of there being a fœtus outside
of the uterus it had now advanced to about the fourth
month of gestation; consequently the most favorable time for
the employment of the electric current had passed. In view
of these facts, and also of the fact that exploratory incisions are
attended with comparatively little danger, it was decided to
make an exploratory incision and determine what was the condition
of things. If a fœtus was found remove it if possible.
If the trouble was something that could not be removed, the
incision could be closed and the patient probably in no wise
injured. Dr. Allen was asked to operate, and on the sixth of
August the operation was performed. There were present,
Dr. Allen, Dr. Scott, Dr. Millikin and the house staff. The
anæsthetic was administered, and before commencing the
operation an aspirator needle of good size was introduced into
the tumor through the vagina. Upon exhausting the air no
fluid was obtained, but upon partially withdrawing the needle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>about a drachm of clear serum was obtained, which was
thought to be peritoneal fluid. It was then decided to proceed
with the operation. An incision was made about an inch
above and parallel to Poupart's ligament, commencing at the
anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and terminating
at the outer margin of the rectus muscle.</p>

<p class='c000'>On opening the abdomen an adherent mass was found closely
attached to the coecum. Strong bands also passed from the
mass toward the symphysis pubis. In order to reach the mass
more fully, and also the annexes of the uterus, the adhesions to
the pubis were divided between ligatures. This having been
done, it was still found to be impossible to detach the intestines
which were closely adherent to the coecum, and nothing abnormal
could be found in connection with the uterus. Failing to
discover the cause of the adhesions about the coecum from the
abdominal cavity, it was thought this might be accomplished
by separating the peritoneum from the iliac fossa, and reaching
the coecum from the outer and posterior side. This separation
was continued until it could be carried no further without great
danger of wounding the external iliac vessels, which were
exposed for several inches. Although nothing further than a
closely adherent mass of intestines had been found, an attempt
to separate which had been carried to the limit of safety, and
the cause of the malady had not been demonstrated with entire
satisfaction, it was deemed best to close the abdominal incision,
which was accordingly done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subsequent history of the cure was as favorable as could
be desired. The wound united very readily. The temperature
never rose above 103°, and was only at that point for a few
hours; most of the time was 100° to 101.5°. Two weeks after
the operation temperature was normal, a point it had not
reached since her admission, and probably not for some time
previous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Patient was examined September 8; the tumor was found to
be considerably diminished in size, and tenderness almost entirely
disappeared. She had apparently gained in weight, and
expressed herself as feeling well. She was discharged from the
hospital September 9. On the tenth of October she again presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>herself, according to agreement, and was examined by
Dr. Scott, Dr. Allen and myself. The tumor had entirely disappeared,
only a slight thickening of the tissues remaining, the
uterus had resumed its normal position, and the patient, to all
appearances, was as well as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have reported this case as one of extra-uterine pregnancy,
and yet it will be seen by the report that the existence of that
condition was not demonstrated at the operation, but it seems
to me that the history of the case, both prior and subsequent
to the operation, demonstrates pretty conclusively that it could
be nothing else. Both the gentlemen who saw the case before
operation were of the opinion that everything could be excluded
except a collection of fluid, disease of the coecum and extra-uterine
pregnancy, and to my mind (and the gentlemen who
were called in consultation have expressed themselves in the
same manner) the operation and the result of it excludes everything
except the last mentioned condition. It may be said that
in the treatment of the case less severe measures should first
have been tried; that the electric current should have been
employed before resorting to an operation. This subject was
fully discussed, and the decision against the employment of
electricity was unanimous, from the fact that the most favorable
time for its employment had passed and the time had arrived
when any further delay was dangerous. Then the danger from
an exploratory incision is so small that it seemed to be more
than counterbalanced by the knowledge that would be obtained
by it. If an exploratory incision was made we would then be
better able to tell what we had to deal with, and would also be
in a position to deal with whatever was found in the most
effectual manner, and it was thought that the most certain
means of cure should be employed first and the patient not be
subjected to the danger of delay in order that less certain
methods might first be tried; also the high temperature seemed
to render any delay more dangerous. The incision described
was employed because it seemed that the tumor could be more
easily reached and removed by means of it than by means of
the central one. When, however, the mass was reached it was
found to be so firmly attached to the cœcum by strong adhesions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>that it was absolutely immoveable. Under these circumstances
it was decided that it would be unwise to attempt its
removal, consequently the wound was closed and the operation
desisted from. The subsequent history was all that could be
desired, or could, under any circumstances, have been expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think the most probable explanation of the disappearance
of the tumor is this: The case was one of extra-uterine pregnancy
of the abdominal variety, the ovum became attached to
the peritoneum and a connective tissue proliferation was set
up which surrounded it with a vascular sack, the walls of which
kept pace with the growth of the ovum, and as they extended
into the abdominal cavity formed adhesions to the cœcum,
intestines, and other parts in the vicinity. During the operation
these adhesions were ligated and divided, and in consequence
the nutrition of the ovum was entirely cut off, and
death and absorption was the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since writing the report of this case the patient has been
seen and examined. She seems to be in perfect health, and
says she never felt better. There is not a vestige of the
tumor remaining, except two or three small indurated spots
that can be felt through the vagina.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>STAMMERING, STUTTERING.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By Prof. G. Delon, late of Paris, France.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Here is an universal and very strange infirmity, impeding
speech, the origin of which must be anterior to the formation
of languages. Hippocrates, the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père de la Médecine</span>,” Galen
and Aristotle attributed it to an abnormal moisture of the brain
and tongue and to a defective construction of the tongue, and
their theories have been revived by modern writers. We find
in Aristotle a double definition that stammering is an inability
of articulating a certain letter, and stuttering an inability of
joining one syllable to another. Notwithstanding the difference
between the causes, the characteristics and the effects of both
defects, several languages have but one word to express it; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>French, for instance, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bégaiement</span>” means either stammering
or stuttering. American dictionaries give the same definition
for both; and in common talk no distinction is made,
all stoppages in speech being called indiscriminately stammering
or stuttering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speech being a combination of separate sounds produced by
the expired air, it is certain that the first condition required for
natural and correct speech is an undisturbed and normal action
of the breathing apparatus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The movements performed by the respiratory organs for the
modification of the currents of air being produced by muscles
owing their activity to nerves—motor and sensory—and the
vocal organs being, like all parts of the organism, provided
with nerves, it becomes evident that a general excitation of the
nervous system, or any unusual excitement of the motor-nerves
in action, will affect the muscles, cause irritation and create disturbances
in inspiration, expiration and speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>Normal inspiration is produced by a regular contraction of
the diaphragm, and expiration is due to the elasticity of
the tissue of the lungs. A spasmodic inspiration, during
which a prolonged contracted spasm of the diaphragm takes
place, produces stammering; such a convulsive contraction of
the diaphragm can take place without attempting to speak,
but any attempt to utter sounds during the spasm will result
in stammering. At the end of the spasm, the air is then
quickly expelled from the lungs. I have noticed stammering children
that I have treated subject to frequent attacks of hiccough;
in hiccough the expiration is quiet: an irritation of the nerves
of the diaphragm brings about, with a violent inspiration, an
attenuated convulsive contraction of the diaphragm, as in stammering.</p>

<p class='c000'>In stuttering which is characterized by the presence of some
spasm, in all articulations, labial, lingual, dental and guttural,
although respiration is irregular and the respiratory organs do
not work well, the inability to form and join the sounds
comes from other sources than a spasmodic contraction of the
diaphragm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stammering proper, when organic, might be called stammering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>of the diaphragm, and that distinction would be quite logical,
as other organs wholly unconnected with speech show that
peculiarity of being affected with stammering.</p>

<p class='c000'>The influence exercised on the voice and speech by the respiratory
mechanism is so considerable that a variety of theories
on respiration have been advanced and discussed by physicians
and specialists, not only with reference to speech impediments
but specially for singing, elocution, acting and public speaking,
and also in reference to general health. Writers and professors
advocating exclusively so-called diaphragmatic, or costal, or
abdominal respiration, are incorrect and perfectly deceived.
The diaphragm, the ribs, and the muscles of the abdomen must
all do more or less their special work, in order to carry on a
normal and healthy respiratory act. An eminent physician,
Dr. Ed. Fournié of Paris, says: “He who respires exclusively
by one or the other of these alone (diaphragm, ribs or abdomen)
must be indeed a sick man.” Costal or side-breathing is due to
the elevation and depression of the ribs simultaneously with the
contraction of the diaphragm. Abdominal breathing, the
method taught to singers, is performed by the pressure of the
abdominal muscles upon the anterior and lateral walls of the abdomen,
forcing up the diaphragm, and thus expiring almost
completely the air in the lungs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Medical and scientific investigations concerning speech defects
have been as considerable as it is contradictory. The observations
of prominent doctors and specialists, some of them being
afflicted themselves, have in the most argumentative thesis attributed
stammering-stuttering to numerous and varied causes,
the enumeration of which has a real historical and pathological
interest:</p>

<p class='c000'>Faulty action of the tongue, disorders of tongue-muscles,
spasms of the glottis and epiglottis, troubles located in the
larynx and in the hyoid-bone, abnormal depth of the palate,
affections of the muscles of the lower jaw, spasm of the lips, abnormal
dryness or moisture, or lesion of brain, nerves, muscles
or tongue, nervous affection, intermittent necrosis<a id='p110'></a>, general
debility or weakness, chorea, incomplete cerebral action, imperfect
will-power, want of harmony between thought and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>speech, imitation and habit.—Such is the nomenclature of the
principal ingenious theories exposed and upheld by those who
have made a study or a business of the cure of speech defects.
But some mistaken innovators, not satisfied with theories and investigations,
gave to their ideas an experimental form. Forty
and forty-five years ago a surgical craze, originating in Germany
as a pretended cure of speech defects, was raging all over
Europe. Stammerers and stutterers suffered a variety of operations,
the horizontal section of the tongue, the division of the
lingual muscles, the division of the genio-hyo-glossi muscles,
the cutting of the tonsils and uvula, etc. Such suppression and
mutilation of the vocal organs could not bring any cure, as it
was proved, and some patients having died, the operating craze
was put to an end forever. Since that it is by more gentle
means that all attempts have been made to cure impediments
of speech. The unfortunate stutterer has no longer to dread
the misemployed zeal of surgical operators, and now it is even
his own fault when he allows himself to fall into the hands of
ignorant charlatans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without lessening the value of former discoveries, I will say
that the specialist of to-day must disagree with the most eminent
authors and the most prominent works on that question, including
Velpeau, Amussat, Becquerel, Lenbuscher, Bèclard, Bristowe,
etc., and arrive at the conclusion that their testimony was
one-sided, being confined to their own or few cases, and limited
to mere theory and speculation. For the treatment of vices of
speech, with the indispensable knowledge, long and practical
experience alone will instruct what is the right method to
pursue. The various theories on the nature and causes of that
infirmity, and the enumeration of the different responsible
organs may be, at the same time, partly false and partially true;
but they have proved powerless to cure or relieve.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all varieties and forms of stammering-stuttering all the
vocal organs can be blamed, and have, in each case, to be reformed
and improved. In the majority of cases we find some
traces of the organic peculiarities aimed at by authors, even if
their influence is doubtful. Respiratory trouble is at the bottom
of every case. The internal organs, and the tongue, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>lips and jaws are to some extent in an abnormal condition, and
suffer a convulsive spasm; they have to be treated, strengthened
and made flexible. The nerve-function of the organs of
speech is also disturbed. We notice in the majority of cases,
to a certain degree, organic weakness, nervousness, lack of
will-power, and above all, disregard of all natural rules and
ignorance of the use and natural functions of the organs of
speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to prognosis, I will say that all stoppages in speech,
accompanied by spasms, sometimes hardly perceptible, and
which are not the result of paralysis or lesion, may be classified
as stammering-stuttering, and can always be cured, whatever
may be their origin or cause, or their intensity, and that it is
only a question of time and perseverance even for the most
stubborn cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>The treatment of stammering-stuttering, which does not
comport any operation nor drugs, is purely educational. It
consists in remedying the defect and teaching properly the
science of speech. Still, I think, that in many cases a strict
attention ought to be paid to hygienic measures; some medical
care and prescription would help the patient and the instructor.
In the actual condition of things no regular practicing
physician can afford to devote his ability and time to the treatment
of speech defects. But doctors have to study the
infirmity, to know that it can be cured, that it is an interesting
and complex disease, in the treatment of which the progress of
medical science can bring a revolution. Physicians the world
over having wholly neglected to consider that question, the
result has been to leave it in the hands of incompetent persons.
In principle the question of speech impediments cannot be
separated from medicine. Physicians cannot ignore an infirmity
in which the organism itself is undoubtedly involved, at times
in a very intricate manner and to a considerable extent. Every
true physician feels that he has a sacred mission—to alleviate
suffering; the tortures of a large class of people partially deprived
of the faculty of speech are well worth his care and
attention. Medical students ought to be provided with the
means of becoming versed in an affection offering such a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>field for study and work, where so much light is needed, and
where the prospects of discovery and improvement from a
scientific and medical standpoint are so legitimate. The family
physician, often consulted, will do good work in advising his
clients to try and get rid of such a terrible affliction, to be cured
without delay, and in preventing them from falling into the
hands of quacks.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>HOMELY FACTS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>BY F. STEWART, CLEVELAND, O.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not long ago as a bottle was placed upon the counter of a
pharmacist to be refilled, its inner walls were observed to be
richly decorated with the active principles of the compound.
A witch-hazel doctor standing by declared the decorated walls
to be the secret of the patient's recovery, but upon inquiry it
was found that the patient was no better. Still they had
decided to try another bottle, and the apothecary was not the
one to object. The investigation was carried no farther, but if
it had been the same old story of <em>incompatibles</em> would have been
retold. To the aqueous solutions containing oleoresinous
tinctures or extracts (such as cannabis indica, guaiac, benzoin,
lupulin, ginger, myrrh, cubeb, eucalyptus, sumbul, and many
others) a sufficient quantity of carbonate or calcined magnesia
should be added. A few grains (say three to twenty) to the
prescribed dose will suffice for a good suspension, and will be
found in most cases unobjectionable of course in an acid mixture.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many conflicting reports of this class of medicines,
owing to unscientific prescribing as well as unreliable preparations.
The activity of this class of medicines demands nothing
short of strong alcohol for their extraction. Yet many weak
and worthless preparations may be found in the market. If the
unscientific observers would look more to the quality of their
goods, these conflicting reports would begin to subside.</p>

<p class='c000'>A physician once told an apothecary that he prescribed fluid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>extracts because he found them more reliable than the tinctures.
This was not true, and could not be proven. Upon
investigation it was found that his prescribed dose of fluid
extract of digitalis was equivalent to fifty-five drops of the
tincture, a dose larger than he intended to prescribe. With
such science the witch-hazel doctor will ride a high horse, and
come in on the home stretch with flying colors. No singer
can sing well who sings too many songs, and no beginner will
prescribe well who prescribes too many medicines. This song
has been sung much but not half enough, for it is not borne
in mind. Many fail with a remedy simply because they have
failed to master it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mastering the few is said to be the key to success, and the
writer believes it, for he has seen it proven. An eminent physician
from New York was once called in consultation to a
western city. His prescription was mercury iodide, potassium
iodide, and infus. gentian. He stated (and the other physician
said, “I see”) that the only object of the potassium was to dissolve
the mercury iodide. But potassium's great affinity for
iodide accepted it, at once dropped the free mercury to the
bottom, likely to be taken all at the last dose, equal to fifteen
or twenty grains of blue pill. He had failed to master this
remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The witch-hazel doctor could not declare this time that the
untaken medicine saved the patient's life, for he died before
taking it. But he could smile at the prescription appropriately,
were none of his own to be found on file.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another phase of fashion reminds one of the old saying
“distance lends enchantment;” for there is just as good
sense in going to New Brunswick to have a boil lanced as there
is in bringing syrup hypophosphates from that place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present pharmacopœia contains a splendid formula for
this syrup—one, too, with which phosphoric acid, quinine and
strychnine are perfectly compatible. A pharmacist that will
not exert himself to furnish the very best article for a physician's
prescription is not entitled to the physician's respect.
But for a physician to expect a pharmacist to send all over town
for some foreign preparation that might, in almost all cases, be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>better made at home, affords a weapon to retard medical science
and advance the nostrum manufacturer. The more scientific
physicians well know and admit that a good pharmacist can
better judge of a compound than a physician, who seldom
stops to test it, but prescribes it a few times and, in many
cases, never thinks of it again, or, perhaps, not until he presents
his bill and finds the patient's money all gone for semi-proprietary
medicines that cost from fifty to one hundred per
cent. more than would have paid for better compounds. Physicians
will only have to examine these medicines after they
have stood a year or two, and in many cases a much less time,
to see the force of this argument.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among these nostrums are found numerous preparations we
could mention, including many emulsions, elixirs, etc. It is
comforting to see the better class of physicians giving these
nostrums a “wide berth.” Others will follow their example if
they investigate and master their remedies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having no time to continue this rehearsal, I close with a <em>plea
for more science, more investigation</em>, that we may not have to
send to Buffalo for syrups of Dover powder or farther east, west or
south for nostrums, but master the remedies we have, saving
to the physician and patient from fifty to one hundred per cent.,
thus mitigating the popular cry of the high price of medicine.
There should be a table of incompatibles in every medical college
as prominent as the multiplication table in the schools, or
pharmacists should be allowed more freedom to prepare medicines
properly, instead of being held to the letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer should not complain, for he has been liberally
treated by the profession in this respect; but he does not feel
at liberty to add magnesia to a mixture unless so ordered. A
pharmacist did this at one time in a tar-and-water mixture,
gaining great praise from the physician. (Making the tar quite
thin with a little alcohol, then absorbing the whole with magnesia,
and emulsifying by adding the water gradually.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying wood-cuts represent the forceps recently
introduced to the profession by Dr. Breus, formerly first assistant
in the clinic of Prof. Carl Braun, Von Fernwald, in Vienna.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is the simplest in construction of the so-called axis traction
forceps, and is specially designed for the extraction of the
head presenting high above the pelvic brim. In size, shape,
curves, handles, lock, etc., it is an exact model of the J. Y.
Simpson forceps—the favorite instrument of the Vienna school.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 1.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Unlike the ordinary forceps, however, it is constructed with a
hinge-joint (<em>a</em> Fig. 2) at the angle of the fenestrum with the shaft,
which permits of a movement of the blades through an arc of
about 40°. An elbow on the lower margin of the blade arrests
the further movement in the downward direction, and a prolongation
of the upper fenestrum of the blade, in the form of
an arm (<em>b</em>), is continued backward parallel to the shafts. This
arm turns at an angle of 100° in front of the lock and terminates
in an eye, through which the split pin seen at the side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>instrument passes. The pin fits loosely in the eyes and restricts,
while still permitting considerable latitude of movement to the
blades. At the suggestion of several gentlemen to whom the
instrument was shown, the shaft has been lengthened nearly
one inch. In other respects the forceps is an exact counterpart
of those now used in the lying-in department of the General
Hospital in Vienna.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The principal advantages secured by these forceps are:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That they are best adapted to draw in the pelvic axis.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the special claim set up by Aveling for his Sigmoid
forceps. Tarnier also, in introducing his axis traction forceps
to the profession in 1877 (for an account of which see <cite>British
Medical Journal</cite>, May 26, 1878), proves by means of diagrams
and figures that, “in pulling on the classical forceps, it is impossible
to make the traction exactly in the line of the pelvic
curve,” and that two forces are actually exerted—one in the
direction of the inferior straight, and the other at right angles
to this in the direction of the pubes, while the head tends
downward in the pelvic curve—the resultant of these two
forces. This “vicious pressure” upon the pubes represents
not only so much force lost, but also tends to injure the maternal
soft parts, and can only be overcome by using the axis traction
forceps. As the head descends, the pelvic curves of the
blades become less and less, until, as the head arrives on the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of the pelvis, the forceps are nearly straight. At the moment
the head sweeps over the perineum the blades are still further
deflected, until they form an angle with the shafts, as shown in
the dotted lines of Fig. 1, thus forming the perineal curve of
Herman's, Aveling's and Tarnier's forceps.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. These forceps give the greatest permissible freedom of
movement to the head during traction.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the loose connection of the blades each possess a degree
of independent movement, but always in a plane parallel to the
other, so that the head may rotate during traction. The carrying
out of this important principle is the chief advantage of
this instrument over all other axis traction forceps.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. An index is supplied by the arms and pin, which serves
to indicate the advance and position of the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The application of Breus' forceps is in no wise more difficult
than that of the ordinary instrument. Having disinfected,
warmed and lubricated the blades, and the patient being prepared
by an irrigation of a solution of bichloride, one part in 2,000,
and placed in the lithotomy position, the handle of the left
blade is taken up by the thumb and three fingers of the left
hand (as one would hold a fiddle bow), the index finger pressing
the projecting arm firmly against the shaft, as the thumb of
the right hand guides the blade forward in the groove between
the index and middle fingers introduced into the vagina. The
right blade is then introduced in a similar manner and locked,
and the pin inserted in the eyes of the projecting arms. The
traction is made upon the handles in the axis of the brim, without
changing its direction until the head presses on the perineum.
Prof. Braun prefers, at this point, to remove the forceps
and complete the delivery in the ordinary way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same precautions are necessary in using the axis traction
as the ordinary forceps. Especially must it be remembered
that, as the force is exerted directly in the axis of the pelvic
curve, and none being lost, much less is required, and generally
the force of one hand is quite sufficient. To avoid too great
compression of the head, the compressing force should be removed
by opening the lock in the interval of each traction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Breus' forceps, after being tested successfully in all possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>difficult cases—in many where the operator had failed with the
ordinary forceps, as I myself have seen—is now recognized as
the instrument best adapted to those cases where the head presents
high above the pelvic brim.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>BALTIMORE NOTES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>BY SPENCER M. FREE, A. M., M. D.,</div>
    <div class='c006'>Professor of Diseases of Children in the Baltimore Polyclinic, Baltimore, Md.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is said of Baltimore that socially it is different from other
large cities in the <em>freedom</em> as well as the cordiality with which
it extends its hospitality. The business men and their clerks
are polite and attentive. They do not display the trait, so common
in the metropolis, of incognizance—even to rudeness—if
one chances to be on a tour of inspection instead of purchase.
The impression is at once made, and very forcibly, that a Baltimorean
has plenty of time, that he is not hurried. He will
stop on the street and direct a discomfited stranger, and has
been frequently known to turn aside from his duties and accompany
the lost one to where he could take care of himself.
This is a natural element in the entire populace, and is very
prominent in the medical profession. A stranger is welcomed
so heartily that he feels at home immediately, and can settle
down among friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>It occurs to me that this easy-going feeling has had much to
do in keeping our city from occupying the prominent position
in education and authorship that her opportunities, and conditions
in general, would lead us to expect. I am glad to say
that she is arousing from her lethargy, and recently her pen
has been busy. Several works have emanated from the profession
here which have attracted much attention, and have been
quite extensively read. Notably among them is a 'Text-book
of Hygiene,' by Dr. Rohe, and 'The Physician Himself,' by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Dr. Cathell, which has reached a fifth edition and a sale of
over fifteen thousand copies. I should like to say, concerning
these two works, that no physician, especially if he be under
thirty-five years of age, should be without them. Two other
works, 'A Manual on Nervous Diseases,' by Dr. A. B. Arnold,
an old, experienced and able teacher, and one on 'Practical
Chemistry,' by Dr. Simon, have been much studied and commented
upon. They are limited to special subjects and will not
naturally obtain a large class of readers. These, like the long-delayed
blade of corn, which pushes its emerald tip heavenward
and bears upon its face the sparkling matin dew, give promise
of a fertile soil and of abundant fruitage.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the last meeting of the Medical and Surgical Society—which
we had the pleasure of attending—there was an interesting
discussion on cerebral troubles of syphilitic origin. A
number of cases were related. The various symptoms of these
maladies are familiar to your readers. The treatment which
was successful in all but one of the cases here reported, was
mercury and iodide of potassium. The plan preferred for the
administration of mercury is by inunction. All the debaters
insisted upon the full constitutional effects of the drugs. As
one gentleman put it, “the system must be saturated before a
cure is assured.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I might mention among the symptoms, that those manifested
by the eye were not regarded as reliable. In one case the only
manifestation was a persistent and severe supra-orbital and occipital
neuralgia, and for some time the man was in consequence
wrongly treated.</p>

<p class='c000'>One physician noted <em>insomnia</em> as a distinct and always present
symptom. Also as a point of differential diagnosis between
the convulsions of epilepsy and those of local lesion of the
brain, that in the former there is no <em>consciousness</em> of having a
convulsion, while in the latter such consciousness is very clear,
at least at the beginning of the spasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>A case of pelvic peritonitis of the chronic form, reported by
the president of the society, elicited much discussion, especially
upon the subject of exploratory abdominal incision as a means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of diagnosis. He noticed that the younger surgeons favored
the operation, but the older ones were more conservative.</p>

<p class='c000'>A member reported one of those peculiarly (excruciatingly,
I ought to say) interesting cases of labor, in which, by <em>great</em>
exertion on his part, and the assistance of two physicians and
three (I think is the number) midwifes or old ladies, he managed
“to save the old man,” though the other parties concerned
passed on into the mysterious future. (The society is
expected to laugh a good deal just here, and of course we
expect the readers to do the same.)</p>

<p class='c000'>At a recent meeting of the Baltimore Medical Association a
member related the following experience: In a family of three
children, the oldest, who had scarlatina four years ago, contracted
diphtheria; in a few days a younger one became ill with
the same disease, but accompanied in forty-eight hours with a
distinct eruption of scarlatina. A few days later the youngest
was stricken with scarlatina, but had no symptom of the diphtheritic
trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report brought out the thought of most of the members
present. The two questions of “the identity of pseudomembranous
croup and diphtheria,” and of “diphtheria a local or a
constitutional disease” were again argued, and, as usual, no
opinions were changed. Like the Scotchman, each was willing
to be convinced, but he could not find any one able to convince
him. Two points were fully agreed upon, namely, that the
presence of membrane in the fauces, and of sequellæ, are not
of importance in diagnosis; also that nearly all of the cases in
which the posterior nares becomes seriously implicated are
fatal. One gentleman advanced the opinion, supported by
“statistics” (as accommodating a friend as “facts”), that
when the submaxillary glands were enlarged in this disease
recovery took place; when they were <em>not</em> enlarged, death
occurred. The doctor did not say that death occurred at once or
within a few days, so we shall be charitable and suppose that
he meant sometime during the succeeding hundred years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notes of two very interesting cases of myelitis, followed by
spastic paraplegia, were read and discussed. The author made
special mention of the exaggerated tendon-reflex being always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>present in disease of the lateral tract of the cord, and that this
symptom is diagnostic—if hysteria be first excluded. He also
noted in these cases that the condition of the muscles of the
posterior portion of the legs (lower) was very tense, producing
an impression on grasping them similar to that noticed on
grasping a piece of iron. Neither of these men were able to
place the heel upon the floor when standing erect. No amount
of effort on their part could enable them to accomplish it.
Neither of them were improved by the use of the iodides.</p>

<p class='c007'>If “K.” will send name, we will take pleasure in publishing
his article in our next number.</p>

<p class='c000'>White physicians in Oriental countries are asked almost daily
whether they cannot prescribe for suffering women without seeing
them. Oriental women, debarred by social custom from
consulting male physicians, are the victims of great and unnecessary
suffering. They are thus shut off from the aid of western
medical skill, though they know its value and are desirous
of availing themselves of it. The movement in China and
Japan to introduce female physicians from Europe and America
is conferring great benefit upon the women of those countries and
making brilliant opportunities for skilled women who go there.
The hospital for women recently opened at Shanghai, under the
charge of American women, is already filled with patients.
An association has also been formed in India for training native
nurses.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>The new college building of the Medical Department of the
Western Reserve University is being pushed rapidly to completion.
The stone-work is done and the roof is now being
placed in position. When once inclosed, work upon the interior
can proceed regardless of the weather. It is thought that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>it will be so far completed as to be used for commencement
exercises the last week in February.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>Four cases of trichiniasis were reported to the health officer
of Cleveland, December 23d. All were members of one family
and had partaken of the same uncooked ham. The physician
reporting the cases, Dr. J. F. Armstrong, had his suspicions
aroused by the symptoms presented, and at once examined the
suspected meat. His fears were confirmed by finding trichinæ
spirolis in the remaining portions of the ham, and his observations
were verified by the health officer. None of those
affected are as yet seriously ill. It appears necessary to sound
a constant warning against eating uncooked pork.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>No Children Allowed.</em>”—The “Solid Comfort” will answer
for the occasion to designate an elegant apartment house
opened about two years ago in a suburb of Boston. It was
finished with all modern conveniences and inconveniences.
There were electric bells in a row at the door, so that the afternoon
caller could ring up nine different and peaceful maid servants
before getting into communication with the family she
came to see; there were fire escapes and telephones, and elevators
and speaking tubes; and, in all probability, safety valves
and submarine cables. But the crowning joy of all was the
fact that no children were allowed within its walls. It was built
for the accommodation of childless couples, and to ten childless
couples were the suites let. How great was the quiet and calm
of that sheltered retreat, until one ill-starred morning, when
the cry of an infant, shrilly and piteously, broke the stillness!
Horror and indignation upon the part of nine guiltless couples!
And yet, so weak is humanity, that before the end of the
second year there were children in seven of the ten families.
The childless young couples were childless no more; and when
the owner of the building complained to his friends of the
unfair treatment he had received at the hands of his tenants,
they all laughed in his face and advised him to let his apartments
to bachelors.—<em>Sanitarian for November, 1885.</em></p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FASHIONABLE HOBBY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is reported that a Dr. Sax, of France, has discovered in
all forms of beverages containing alcohol a “bacillus potumaniæ;”
and it is claimed that this bacillus multiplies in the
system of the drinker and circulates in his blood, and that when
he gets delirium tremens he is not the subject of hallucinations
but sees the reptilian forms that are inhabiting his own brain
and optic apparatus.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the microscopists and various ologists are discussing
this, we will tell a story of a certain worthy practitioner of our
acquaintance. The doctor's hobby was malaria. If a person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>came in with a headache it was “malarial headache;” backache,
“malarial backache;” legs ache, “malaria.” One day
a man came in with his arm hanging helpless. Our friend
promptly began about malaria. The man said he had heard
of break-bone fever, but that he had fallen off a street car and
didn't think this was a malarial fracture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the best fellows we know ride hobbies, but let those
who now bestride the bacillus beware where the creature carries
them.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OLEOMARGARINE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The subject of artificial butter continues to agitate the public
mind and stomach. There are involved a few plain principles
which, if applied, will elucidate the whole matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good glycerine can be made from dogs or horse fat, sugar
from rags; sea water or the most impure lake or river water
can be changed to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">azua pura</span></i> by distillation; good suet or tallow
can be so treated as to make a nutritious and harmless
article of diet. Now, if old grease can be so manipulated and
modified as to give a pure and edible result, cheaper than old-fashioned
butter, the latter will have to go out of fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that case, wrong would lie only in selling the article for
what it is not, and not in the fact of its being also injurious to
the user. Just as in many synthetically manufactured wines
and cigars, which are not chemically essentially different from
the article they imitate, but are fraudulent because they are
sold as imported or genuine, which they are not.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the goods are good, let them be sold for what they really
are; and if the old-fashioned butter is higher priced, let those
of us who like pay the difference for our fastidiousness. The
manufacturers of the new butter should expend their efforts
and their money in perfecting their process, so as to give an
innocent and useful food, and in proving that it is so, instead
of opposing the action of the Board of Health. The verdict
of the health authorities should be regarded as final by every
individual of the public, and until the new article is pronounced
at least harmless, no one should think of using or handling it
any more than they would measly pork or spoilt fish.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>MEDICAL DEFENCE ASSOCIATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We have selected a few recent cases of suits for malpractice
with the object of calling the attention of physicians to the
importance of adopting some plan looking toward the suppression
of quackery and the protection of professional rights when
assailed by hostile influences.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In April, 1884, Dr. Graves of Petaluma, California, was
called to see Mrs. Winters, the wife of a laborer whose family
he had attended gratuitously for nearly sixteen years. He
found that the woman, who was fifty-eight years of age, had
fallen from a height and injured her ankle. The limb was very
much swollen, so as to interfere with examination, but no
crepitus could be elicited, neither was there any displacement,
or shortening; and as the swelling continued, the limb was
placed in position and wrapped loosely in cloth saturated with
anodyne lotions. The patient, we are told, received every
attention from Dr. Graves, but there was left finally some stiffening
of the joint and a very slight inversion of the foot. No
complaints were made until a new doctor arrived in the
town, who told the patient the limb had been badly
treated and advised her to sue for malpractice. The case
was examined by ten of the chief surgeons in the
State, including Drs. Lane, McLean, Morse and Dennis,
all of whom said that there might have been a sprain or an
incomplete fracture of the external malleolus, but that the ends
of the bones were in perfect apposition and never had been
separated, and that the stiffening was probably due to inflammatory
adhesions. Two other doctors, one of whom being he
who advised the suit, testified that there was shortening of the
limb, and that the lower fragment of the tibia had been driven
up and behind the fibula. One of these would-be surgeons,
Dr. Wells, is nearly eighty years of age, and had not read a
work on surgery for thirty years; the other, Dr. Ivancovich,
confessed he had no special experience in surgery. Their
incompetence may be judged from the way they measured the
patient's limb in court. This was done by taking a carpenter's
rigid rectangular rule, and measuring the limb as she maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the upright position. The result was that in the opinion of
nine jurymen the testimony of two unknown, inexperienced
general practitioners out-weighed that of ten specialists in
surgery, all of whom possess a national reputation, so that a
verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff, awarding her eight
thousand dollars damages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some three years ago Dr. Purdy, a well-known and
esteemed physician, gave notice to the health department of
New York City, in accordance with a regulation of the sanitary
code which makes it the duty of physicians to notify this
department of cases of infectious diseases, that in his opinion
a young woman who was under his treatment was suffering
with smallpox. The department sent one of its medical
officers to investigate the case. The diagnosis made by Dr.
Purdy was then confirmed and by the authority of the board
of health the patient was transferred to the smallpox hospital.
After a day or two the patient was discharged. This patient
immediately brought suit against Dr. Purdy for $10,000 damages,
on the ground of injury to her business and of the false
diagnosis upon the part of her medical attendance. The jury
which tried this case gave a verdict of $500 against the defendant.
The singular injustice of this verdict resides in the
fact that damages should have been brought against Dr.
Purdy, when, in point of fact, the injury to the plaintiff was
inflicted by the health department, which not only affirmed the
diagnosis of the attending physician, but caused the removal
of the patient to be made to the smallpox hospital. It appears
that Dr. Purdy's sole error in the case was in informing the
health authorities of the possible existence of smallpox. In
the discharge of a duty imposed upon him by a city ordinance
he has been subjected to the expense and annoyance of a
legal case, and has been mulcted by a jury to the extent of
$500.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Another suit of a blackmailing character has been brought
against Dr. E. Williams and partners of Cincinnati, O. According
to the Cincinnati <cite>Medical News</cite>, the charge was that
they had permitted a small scale of iron, that had entered the
eye of a boy, to remain, by which he eventually became blind—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>sound eye becoming affected through sympathy with the
injured one and losing the power of vision. It was proven on
trial that the boy had visited the office of Dr. Williams but
twice, and then had ceased calling because he was informed
that, to preserve the sound eye and be saved from blindness,
he must consent to have the eye that had been destroyed removed
from its socket, to which his parents would not consent.
For several months after declining the services of Dr. Williams
and associates, he spent his time in going the rounds of the
specialists of diseases of the eye, putting his case in charge, at
different times, of both regular and homœopathic physicians.
Every ophthalmologist by whom he was treated informed him
that the only way by which he could avoid becoming blind was
to have the injured eye removed. Finally, after losing sight in
both eyes, he brought suit. The medical testimony, we are
told, was uniformly in favor of Dr. Williams, but the jury
disagreed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Boston correspondent of <cite>The Northwestern Lancet</cite>
writes: 'Dr. A., a reputable practitioner living in a New England
city, attended Mr. B. for a fractured thigh. The case did
well, and the patient recovered without deformity. No measurements
were recorded by the attending surgeon, but he was
able to swear that the result was to him perfectly satisfactory.
A year or two later the patient entered suit against Dr. A. for
malpractice, and exhibited a leg considerably shortened and
deformed. A jury at once found a verdict for the plaintiff, and
awarded damages in some six or seven thousand dollars, a sum
which seriously crippled the physician. He devoted his energies
thereafter to discovering what he believed to be a fraud,
and finally obtained evidence that B. had, subsequently to his
recovery under A.'s attendance, again fractured the same thigh
while in the Adirondack wilderness, and had, on that occasion,
had no surgical attendance whatever. The physician was able
to recover his money, but was at the expense of his detectives'
and lawyers' fees, to say nothing of years of anxiety and of
damage to his professional reputation.'”</p>

<p class='c000'>The case of Drs. Reed and Ford of Norwalk, Ohio, will be
remembered by many Cleveland physicians. Miss Pierce, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>comely young lady, sustained a Colles fracture, and was attended
by Drs. Reed and Ford. Suit was brought twice in county
court and dismissed because plaintiff did not desire to
try the case. A few days before the case was outlawed, suit
was brought in the United States Court at Cleveland. Many
physicians were called on both sides, and the testimony of all
the physicians, with probably one exception, was that the
treatment was good and the result better than is usual with
such fractures. Flexion extension, pronation and supination
were perfect. She had, however, the power, when the arm was
midway between pronation and supination, of bending the
wrist toward the radius, and by making the head of the ulna
prominent she was able to make an apparent deformity. Her
case, then, was her ability to make an apparent deformity by
twisting her wrist. (She could do the same with the unfractured
wrist.) She was a good-looking woman, and therefore
entitled to sympathy. She followed up the case persistently
for six years, therefore there must be some merit in the case.
The doctors all testified against her, so there was a combination
of the doctors which must not be countenanced. Upon this
strong case twelve intelligent jurors awarded thirteen hundred
dollars damages. The judge subsequently reduced this to five
hundred. Is it any wonder, when such things can be done in
the State of Ohio, in the name of justice, that physicians like
old Dr. Kirtland refused to attend cases of fracture under any
circumstances? or that it is not unusual to hear surgeons
of recognized ability say they dare not possess property for fear
of suits for damages?</p>

<p class='c000'>Frequently physicians are accused of malpractice, and rather
than undergo the expense and inconvenience of a suit they will
submit to an extortion of money; or if a suit is lost in court
through prejudice, unjust decisions, inability to secure good
council or other unavoidable cause, rather than undertake to
carry the case to a higher court, the physician will pay the
damages, and thus establish a precedent which renders every
physician under similar circumstances liable to a suit for
damages. It is always observed whenever a large amount of
damages is collected from a physician, numerous other suits on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>all sorts of cases are commenced. Such a condition of affairs
ought not to exist. Physicians can not expect legislators to
look after their interests until their grievances are made known.
The testimony of physicians as individuals will not carry enough
weight to accomplish anything. Moves have been made in
this direction through the County and State societies and failed
first, because the members of the societies are divided among
themselves, second, because they represent only a fractional
portion of the profession. Out of the thousands of physicians
practicing in Ohio there are only about seven hundred members
of the State society.</p>

<p class='c000'>We believe the object of county, state and national medical
societies are intended for purely scientific work, and the less
of medical politics brought into them the better. But when
there is some definite end to be accomplished, some gross
wrong to be righted, some persecuted physician defended, there
ought to be some organization including physicians of all
schools, independent of the medical societies as now organized.
When a physician is sued for damages, if his case is worthy
of being defended, the entire profession ought to lend him their
moral as well as financial support, and this could be rendered
in no way better than by means of some organization similar to
the Medical Defense Association of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pioneer Medicine on the Western Reserve” is the title of
a series of articles which began in the November (1885) number
of the Magazine of Western History (Williams &amp; Co.,
Cleveland). They are written by Dr. Dudley P. Allen, which
insures a warm interest in the subject as well as a capable handling
of it. The series is historical and biographical, and the
publisher promises several portraits before the last chapter in
March or April. Probably none of the Magazine's various
serials will be of more interest to the public, as well as to medical
men generally. In the opening chapters we enjoyed the
author's skillful joining into readable continuity of the broken
facts that have been gathered from so long ago.</p>

to order, and owing to the number of papers to be presented
and the brief time for the session, ordered the omission of
reading of minutes of last meeting and all miscellaneous business.
E. H. Hyatt of Delaware, was first called, and excused
on the ground that he could not do justice to his subject, “The
Use and Abuse of Alcohol from a Professional Standpoint,”
in so short a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <span class='sc'>R. Harvey Reed</span> of Mansfield, the appointed lecturer,
read a paper on Anæsthetics, in which he gave a brief review
of the different general and local anæsthetics in use and the
different compounds of the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>He referred to the elaborate experiments of Dr. Watson of
Jersey City, which showed the following mortality on rabbits:</p>

<p class='c000'>The author referred to a number of experiments he had made
on frogs, in which vivisection was made, and the heart exposed
and chloroform applied direct, from which they died in from
ten to twenty minutes, and when bromide of ethyl was used in
fifteen to thirty minutes, but when ether was used, and even
much freer than either of the others, they did not die at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>In repeated experiments, he said, he had found the use of
electricity unreliable in resuscitating the heart under these circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>After referring to the mortality reports which showed 405
deaths from chloroform against seventeen from ether, he said:
“I feel that every time I use chloroform as an anæsthetic I am
trifling with a dangerous compound, and that it will only require
time and perseverance in its use until I will share the fate
of many others, whose misfortunes ought to be a timely warning
to us against its dangerous effects; and if not heeded an
accident will be all the more inexcusable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He condemned the use of so-called “vitalized air” as being
an uncertain and unstable compound: being one of the nitro-oxygen
series mixed with chloroform, its effects were uncertain
and often very injurious, which, he said, “should be
reason enough to deter any conscientious physician from using
it or even recommending it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For administering anæsthetics the author recommended a
clean folded towel as being more preferable than anything else,
as it was just as efficient and decidedly better from a sanitary
standpoint.</p>

<p class='c000'>He recommended watching the pulse closely while administering
chloroform, and the respirations when ether was administered,
lest in the former the cardiac ganglia become affected
and suddenly arrest the heart's action, or in the latter the nerve
cells of the medulla from its toxic effects abruptly interfere
with the breathing.</p>

<p class='c000'>In closing the author said: “From the brief review of the
anæsthetics most familiar to the profession from a practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>standpoint we have arrived at the following conclusions:”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First</em>—Of all general anæsthetics known pure sulphuric ether
stands at the head for safety, efficiency and every day practical
use.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second</em>—Hydrochlorate of cocaine stands at the head of all
known local anæsthetics.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Third</em>—Ethidene promises to rival ether and merits a more
general and extended trial.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fourth</em>—No surgeon should give any anæsthetics without
being prepared to resuscitate the patient on the shortest possible
notice if necessary, among which preparations nitrite of
amyl stands preëminent.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fifth</em>—No person should be entrusted with the administration
of any anæsthetic who is not thoroughly familiar with its physiological
action and practical administration.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sixth</em>—The indiscriminate use of anæsthetics should be strenuously
guarded against, and especially the practice of leaving
such dangerous compounds in the hands of the laity to be given
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i> whenever they may deem it necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Seventh</em>—The judicious use of anæsthetics under all necessary
circumstances should never be omitted, for when properly used
by skilled hands they are a glorious haven of peace in the midst
of a stormy sea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. J. Campbell</span> of Galion reported a case of embolism, in
which the diagnosis was uncertain, the symptoms grave and
the disturbance of the circulation extremely severe, distinguished
physicians differing widely as to the pathological conditions,
and the autopsy revealed adhesions of the right lung
and of the pericardum. Left lung compressed, left heart hypetrophied
and stenosis of aortic orifice. On motion the case
was referred to the committee on publication, and Drs. Hackendorn,
Ridgway and Mitchell, who had seen the patient, were
requested to give their views.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. N. B. Ridgway</span> reported a case of laceration of perinæum

<h3 class='c012'>THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>ANNUAL MEETING HELD AT WASHINGTON, D. C., DEC. 8-12, 1885.</div>
    <div class='c006'>[By G. C. Ashmun, M. D., Health Officer, Cleveland, O.]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1873 a few gentlemen met at Long Branch,
New Jersey, and organized as the “American Public Health
Association.” At that time there were but few state boards
of health, and local boards were not generally efficient; and it
was one of the chief objects of the American Public Health
Association to aid in the establishment of health and sanitary
organizations throughout the country. Prominent among the
original members of the association were gentlemen from the
Mississippi valley. For a long time the cities and towns of that
valley had suffered from visitations of yellow fever, and men
had become somewhat enlightened by the good results obtained
from the course pursued by certain officers during the war.
Especially was this true in New Orleans, and the question was
fairly raised whether local conditions were not responsible for
the disastrous outbreaks which had occurred so frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 1873 to the present time, there have been annual meetings
of the association, with a greatly enlarged membership.
A large result of the efforts of the association and its members
is seen in the national, state and local boards of health, and
other sanitary organizations throughout the country. But three
of the states are now without state organizations. The recent
meeting in Washington was its “thirteenth annual,” and was
as well attended and its members as enthusiastic as at any.
The members were “welcomed” on behalf the medical fraternity
of Washington by the venerable Dr. J. M. Toner, and by
the district authorities through the President of the Board of
Commissioners, Judge Edmonds. These remarks were followed
by the usual address by the president of the association, Dr.
Reeves of West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The chief point, perhaps, of Dr. Reeves' address, and the
one calling out most expressions of approval, was the arraignment
of Congress for its failure to provide means for the support
of the National Board of Health. He cited the liberality
shown to care for domestic animals, the fisheries, the Indians,
and, indeed, almost every conceivable object, but Congress was
unwilling to grant even a sum sufficient for gathering and publishing
the reports from local boards. He expressed a strong
feeling against the attempt to have the work for which the
National Board was created to perform, done by the Marine
Hospital Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large part of the time of the meetings was taken up in
hearing reports from committees appointed at the meeting in
St. Louis, 1884. Among these reports were some of great
interest. Prof. Sargent, of Harvard, gave a report upon
“School Hygiene in American Schools and Colleges,” and this
was enlarged by a paper from Dr. Hartwell, of John Hopkins
University, on “The German System of Physical Education.”
At this meeting prizes were to be awarded, in accordance with
the wish of Mr. Lomb, of Baush &amp; Lomb, Rochester. The
subjects were:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. “Healthy homes and food for the working classes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>2. “The sanitary conditions and necessities of school-houses
and school life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>3. On “Disinfection and individual prophylaxis against
infectious diseases.”</p>

<p class='c000'>4. On “Preventable causes of disease, injury, and death in
American manufactories and workshops, and the best means
and appliances for preventing and avoiding them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These prizes were in cash, and amounted to five hundred
dollars each, the decision resting with a separate committee for
each. Without taking more space, it may be said that these
meetings are usually attended by about three hundred members,
from all parts of the country. Canada sends representatives,
and the meeting in 1886 is to be held in Toronto. Very
diverse opinions are developed, and sharp discussions are the
order. All shades of medical and lay topics and views are
brought out, but all meet on the common ground of desire for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>improvement in health. The medical officers of the army and
navy are always well represented by such men as Drs. Billings,
Sternberg, Gihon, Turner and others, while Hon. Erastus
Brooks of New York is a layman whose views have been and
still are relied upon as representing a philanthropic sentiment
which can be found in all communities.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CUYAHOGA COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY—ADJOURNED MEETING, OCTOBER 15<sup>TH.</sup></h3>

<h4 class='c018'>REPORTED BY L. B. TUCKERMAN, COR. SEC.</h4>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dr. Himes</span> presided.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Powell</span> gave a verbal report on the progress of obstetrics
and diseases of children as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c018'>OBSTETRICS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>In the department of obstetric literature, 'Barnes' Obstetrics'
had just been published by Lea. It was encyclopædic in its
character. Lusk had issued a new edition with several chapters
added. Parvin's book was now in press, and is also issued
by Lea. In the department of diseases of children, Eustace
Smith's work is invaluable as regards symptomatology and
clinical history, but is not so good in therapeutics. Goodhart's
work, edited by Starr, is also of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Axis traction forceps are coming more and more into favor,
Lusk's modification of Sarnier's forceps being used. Simpson's
axis traction forceps is also much used in this country and in
Germany. The form used by Dr. Lusk's assistant and in use
in Karl Braun's maternite in Vienna, with a hinge jaw where
the blade joins the shaft and traction handles, allows more motion
of the head and has a number of other advantages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Electricity is coming more and more in vogue as an oxystocic.
It seems to hasten labor without increasing pain. Its
use to destroy the life of the fœtus in fallopian pregnancy is
more common in this country than in Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the past two years Lawson Tait has operated five times
for ruptured fœtal cyst, with four recoveries. There are no
other cases on record so far as known to the reporter. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>present tendency of professional opinion is to favor an immediate
operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intra-uterine injections are not so freely used as formerly,
and are restricted to cases where there is actual retention of
putrid material in the uterine cavity, with fever. Bichloride of
mercury is gaining ground as the antiseptic par excellence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cocaine has been tried to relieve the pain during dilation
of the os, but has not proved a success. It is, however, a success
in relieving certain cases of obstinate vomiting of pregnancy,
and also the pain of fissured nipples.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hicks' bimanual method of treating placenta previa is gaining
ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with post partum fever, a larger number of
cases of diphtheritic complications is noted than formerly.</p>

<h4 class='c018'>DISEASES OF CHILDREN.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Crede claimed to be able to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum
by instilling into each eye at birth two drops of a two per cent.
solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cassels of Berlin, after an exhaustive investigation, claims
that no remedies are so reliable in <em>pertussis</em> as belladonna and
quinia.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the treatment of <em>diphtheria</em>, Tr. Ferri and Potass.
Chloras seem to stand as high as ever in the opinion of the
profession. Calomel, which also has its admirers, seems to
have lost no ground, as well as the use of the steam atomizer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Allen</span> presented a dermoid cyst of the left ovary,
removed that forenoon from a nullipara aged twenty-seven.
Six hours after the operation the patient's temperature was
99.6° Fahr., and there had been but little vomiting.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Sihler</span> showed a gall stone found at the autopsy of a
woman forty-eight years old, whose symptoms had not been
those which are usual in fatal cases of obstruction of the gall
duct. There had been no jaundice, no bile in the urine and no
previous attacks of pain. She complained one morning of sore
throat, and was given one-eighth of a grain of morphia. In
the evening there was pain in the stomach and the morphia
was discontinued. This was on Saturday. By Sunday or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Monday the pain had become located along the border of the
liver. On Tuesday the free edge of the liver could be felt, and
the temperature had risen to 102° or 103°, pain and vomiting
having also become very severe. The next week pain was less
and swelling less, and in two weeks all symptoms were gone.
She never before had symptoms of colic. Two weeks later,
after she had been asleep about three hours, she had another
attack. The next day the temperature rose again, and there
was a larger region of sensitiveness than before. On Tuesday
the fever subsided. On Wednesday collapse and vomiting
ensued, ending in death. The autopsy disclosed adhesions of
the liver, omentum and colon, an effusion of bile in the tissues,
and this gall stone was found in the gall bladder.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Allen</span> mentioned a case that he had seen in Keith's
Clinic in Edinburgh, where an operation was undertaken for
ovarian cyst, but when on opening the abdomen the tumor was
found to be the gall bladder so enlarged as to fill the whole
lower part of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Sihler</span> said that in his case the gall bladder was not so
very much enlarged.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tuckerman</span> reported a case where a gall stone the size
of a pigeon's egg was found post mortem, but which during
life could sometimes be felt through the abdominal wall and
sometimes not, and which gave rise to a bruit so distinct as to
warrant a strong suspicion of aneurysm.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Vance</span> stated that according to his observation the passage
of a gall stone into the intestine by ulceration was a common
cause of intestinal obstruction. He also called attention
to the value of the symptom of itching as pointing to the gall
bladder as the seat of the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dr. Linhart</span> reported a post mortem in a case of typhoid
fever where eighty-five small stones were found in the gall
bladder. The bladder was but little distended.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, the fourth work which the author has written on dermatology,
is intended to present, in a clear and concise way, a
resumé of the more voluminous books which have preceded it.
Unfortunately the dermatology of to-day, as it appears in the
English language, is drawn largely from the precepts of the
Vienna school. In fact, since the little volume of Robert
Liveing, which appeared in London about eight years ago, there
has been no truly English or American treatise on the subject;
although books on diseases of the skin have appeared in quick
succession, they have been vague echoes from the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krankenhaus
in Wien.</span></i> Do not think from this that I undervalue the original
work done by the great teachers of local dermatology, for they
have taken vast strides in the advancement of the science, but
other lines of thought and investigation are needed to broaden
the scope of the earnest student. The work before me, as its
name implies, is a practical treatise on diseases of the skin, of
about four hundred pages, with especial attention to diagnosis
and treatment. To facilitate the former, the author has
grouped cutaneous maladies which are alike in nature into what
he calls <em>Diatheses</em>, of which the syphilitic, scrofulous, herpetic,
cancerous and the congestive are dwelt upon. In differentiating
the scrofulous from the syphilitic diatheses, the author says:
“In the third stage of syphilis, as we have said, the work of
destruction starts from within, attacking first the deeper structures,
as the periostium cartilage and bone, whereas scrofula
pursues the same destructive course inversely; that is to say,
from the superficial to the deep parts. This consideration, upon
which we cannot insist too strongly, is of the greatest importance
in diagnosis. For example, if syphilis attacks the nose,
the part first involved is the mucous membrane of the nasal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fosæ, then the nasal bones and cartilages, which may become
completely destroyed before the process subsides, leaving the
nose flattened but the skin intact. In scrofula the work of disorganization
begins in the superficial parts—the skin—and not
until the part involved is completely destroyed does it proceed
to those which are deeper, viz., the cartilage and bone. Again,
it may be seen that the destruction is more complete in scrofula
than in syphilis. This is especially true of the skin, for syphilis
has at least a respect for this organ, which scrofula has not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After establishing, as he says, “the principles upon which the
scrofulous diathesis is founded,” he proceeds to enumerate the
different <em>scrofulides</em> of the skin as follows: 1, Erythematous;
2, Phlegmonous; 3, Pustulo-crustaciæ; 4, Tuburcular; 5,
Rupiform; 6, Ulcero-gumatous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The herpetic diatheses.</span>—“The distinctive feature of prime
import in herpetic lesions (<em>herpidites</em>) is their duration. In the
two diathesis we have just considered we have said that the
<em>scrofulides</em> are continuous in their duration; they present no interruption,
no intermittance; whereas the <em>syphilides</em> are essentially
intermittent; they disappear spontaneously, or under the
influence of treatment, and reappear without regularity or
periodicity. Their intervals of latency are variable, often regulated
by the change of season, especially liable to reappear in
the springtime, and sometimes after many years of complete
immunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The <em>herpidites</em> combine in their evolution the two characters
of intermittency and chronicity. At their commencement they
are intermittent; in the second stage, which occurs after a certain
though variable period, they assume the character of
chronicity.” The author further divides the <em>herpidites</em> into benign
and malignant. Under the former are included herpes,
impetigo, lichen, eczema and psoriasis; the latter includes
pemphigus, cachectic rupia and prurigo senilis formicans. The
cancerous and the congestive diatheses follow, after which the
exanthemata and the cachectic diseases of the skin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Symptomatic affections of the skin</span>, arising from pathological,
physiological and psychological disturbances are probably of
more interest than any other group, because here one finds so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>many things not even mentioned in most works on dermatology,
and because this class of affections seems destined more
and more to be a common inherent of American life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These diseases, which are called diseases of the skin, are
not so in reality. They belong more or less to the entire
organism, revealing themselves upon the external integument
with visible and palpable peculiarities which enable us to form
an opinion as to their true nature. Considering the subject
from this point of view, dermatology is therefore one of the
most important branches of pathology; it is the torch which
throws light on many morbid conditions which otherwise would
remain obscure, vague and unsettled. But dermatology is
more than this; it is the index, the external manifestation of
disturbances which may be physiological or pathological, superficially
or deeply seated. It is still more, for it is the visible
expression of certain psychological emotions and moral states
which are reflected upon the skin, there to be interpreted by
the observing student.” This part of the work ends with a
chapter on dermatoses of local origin, which includes parasitic
affections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book concludes by taking up the treatment of the different
diseases one by one. In the treatment of syphilis the
author says: “The preparation of mercury to which we give
the preference is the proto iodide. It is less dangerous, more
soluable in the stomach and more easily assimilated. It should
never be given to exceed three centigrammes a day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Time forbids further details. I will simply say the book is a
good one, and will well repay careful study. Arrangements
have been made with the author and his publishers to translate
the work into English.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
